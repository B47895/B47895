- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrea, but on the Internet you can call me Neuron
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in bioinformatics.. also a little bit of neurology, psychology and informatics in general

I'm currently a MSc student in Tartu University studying molecular biology. Specifically my studies focus on bioinformatics. I did my BSc thesis on k-mers in eukaryotes, but during my MSc studies I have focused my attention more on 16S amplicon sequencing and bacterial genomes (assembly and primer design).
I work at a biotechnology company focusing on bacteria as a molecular biologist which I try to interweave with my studies as much as possible, which is why I've concentrated more on bacteria as of recent. My goal is to improve the world as much as I can within my lifetime, which I hope will be possible within my current field. 
I'm hoping to start my PhD studies once I'm done with MSc.
